* Machine Learning Tutorial
From Programming with Mosh

I knew absolutely nothing about ML learning before taking this tutorial. It's a topic I've always shied away from. I randomly decided to watch this tutorial and, 
actually, it wasn't so scary!

I'd heard of Jupyter Notebooks, but had no idea what they were. Also, I've learned how to add them to Git and manage them with version control. Amazing!

I've written my few notes down here, so I can easily review them in future.
