# Machine Learning Tutorial
From Programming with Mosh

I knew absolutely nothing about ML learning before taking this tutorial. It's a topic I've always shied away from. I randomly decided to watch this tutorial and, actually, it wasn't so scary!

I'd heard of Jupyter Notebooks, but had no idea what they were. Also, I've learned how to add them to Git and manage them with version control. Amazing!

I've written my few notes down here, so I can easily review them in future. 

## Notes
Using data for Machine Learning, we need to:
1. Import the data
2. Clean the data
3. Split the data into training/test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate

Different libraries and their uses:
* Numpy- provides multi-dimensional array
* Pandas- data analysis library; provides data frames (2D data structure, like a spreadsheet)
* MatPlotLib- 2D plotting library for creating graphs and plots
* Scikitlearn- very popular for ML; provides algorithms like decision trees, neural networks, etc.

Jupyter is good for ML as we frequently need to inspect the data. Can run each 'cell' independently. Green band on a cell is edit mode, blue band is command mode. 

Shortcuts: 'b' for cell below, 'a' for cell above, 'dd' to delete. 

Pandas gives us access to data frame, which is a 2D data structure like a spreadsheet. 
Import pandas library. Create a pandas object and call methods on it. Some key methods are:

* .shape(): returns total rows and total columns
* .values(): returns an array; the outer one is the row
* .describe(): returns basic statistics, such as count (number of records in each column), mean, standard deviation (variance between the sets), min, max, 25%, 50%, 75%.
